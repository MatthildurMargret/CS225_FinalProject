CS225 Final Project - Spring 2024

This project explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve solving the Job-Shop Scheduling Problem, a complex NP-hard combinatorial optimization challenge in labor scheduling. Traditionally solved using the branch-and-bound (B&B) method, this approach relies on expert-crafted heuristics that, while effective, may lack generalization and fail to capture inherent patterns. By integrating GNNs, we aim to enhance the B&B algorithm's efficiency by predicting better branching decisions, ultimately minimizing labor while maximizing output in scheduling tasks. This project demonstrates the potential of GNN-guided methods in optimizing labor scheduling solutions.
